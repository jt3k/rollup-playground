# React, Redux, Provider and JSX support

Shows how to use a react-redux provider together with preact. I took the old reference project with the counters and converted it to use react-redux instead of just redux directly.

### How to use
`npm install` to download all dependencies for building.

`npm run build` to actually build the app.

`npm run server` to host a simple server on port 8000 where you can test the app.
