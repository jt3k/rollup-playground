# React, Redux, JSX and Decorators (together with TypeScript) support

This simple app is compiled to only 48kb (1634 lines) of code while using both React (preact), Redux and JSX.

I have been searching far and wide on the internet to find something like this for myself but I actually had to make the example by myself. Hope it brings joy and ease of mind to someone else out there!


### How to use
`npm install` to download all dependencies for building.

`npm run build` to actually build the app.

`npm run server` to host a simple server on port 8000 where you can test the app.
