# What?

This repository serves as a playground for rollup integrations. There are a few subfolders with example projects using rollup. Have a look around in the different folders to see some examples.

### Why?

Well simply because I'm fairly new to ES6 and JS bundlers in general and wanted to practice setting up a few different projects with different purposes. Hopefully other people around me can find something useful here as well :)

I'm from "camp native" but have not shied away from doing some JS from time to time but never building a full application from the ground up by myself in JS.

I think it's time to change that!

### What is rollup?
Rollup is a fantastic JS bundler that uses tree-shaking to optimize away code that you do not use. I have had the opportunity to be very biased by my friend and colleague (who is quite active in the development of rollup) to think that rollup is the best bundler out there ;)
